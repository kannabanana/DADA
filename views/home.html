<h2 align=center>Beginning/Learning How To Use The VM</h2>

</p>
 I changed evil.exe, executed and tried to search for hints that evil.exe had been executed.  I went into my computer I could see the list of newly created/modified folder (1/17/2016) under local disk including ntldrs, under which has two files funbots and svchest. The day before I accidently named the file evil.exe.bin and ran the detection software tools which resulted in the FLYPAPER.SYS file. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
However, I realized because I executed evil.exe before I was supposed to, I had to revert to baseline snapshot and start over. So after renaming evil.exe, I started up the correct tools and took a snapshot.  I noticed that because I took a snapshot with all the programs running in the background, the snapshot would lag and eventually crash. In the future, I have kept reverting back to the snapshot of renamed evil.exe as my new baseline.
</p>
<br>
<h2 align=center>Analysis:</h2>

<p>
 I executed evil.exe and got a popup Fakenet around 1pm and observed it under the processes monitor. You can see under process explorer, under the explorer.exe directory there are several evil.exe. After highlighting evil.exe, I saw how many process are consumed by evil.exe. In particular, you can see that operations performed by evil.exe include regclosekey, regdeletekey, regopenkey, regqueryvalue, querydirectories, closefile, openfiles etc. This is a good starting point, because it shows us which files/directories to look at next. There’s even a fake command prompt running under cmd.exe. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
	I ran processmon before executing evil.exe by reverting to the older snapshot. Prior to running it, there was no evil.exe. Clicking properties and strings, you can see a list of associated strings to evil.exe, including the run command (software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\run). Furthermore, we can get the process id (3008). 
</p>
<br>
<p>

Under Antispy software, I was able to find the registry keys (HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\). HKCU is HKEY for the current user and replaced the key value. Antispy highlighted only a few programs in blue, including evil.exe. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
The instructions asked us to find several items and explore them further. For example, C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts is the extension to Windows Host file, which is used to block or redirect hostnames. The /t /g everyone:F means Recurse down through existing directory structures and grant everyone access. I checked file extension before I executed evil.exe, and the only thing inside the file is comments on how to use the file. After execution, all of the lines remained commented. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
I tried to execute attrib -r -a -s -h C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts. The windows attrib command essentially displays/removes/sets all the hidden attributes of files/directories. The -r clears read-only, -a clears archive file, -s clears system file, and -h clears the hidden file attribute. When I run attrib under the directory, there are four files. I used the attrib windows command which shows hidden files under C:/Users/Admin. This listed about 7 files under the admin file. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
I tried to investigate the file-locations using cmd and I could only see C:\ntldrs\funbots.bat and C:\ntldrs\system.yf under the listed file directories. Whereas, C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files\Content.IE5\KLTT2YG3\pao[1].exe, C:\Program Files\tongji2.exe, C:\ntldrs\svchest.exe, C:\ntldrs\Isinter.gif could not be found in under the given path. Several of these files are deleted once evil.exe are deleted and must be noticed mid-run. This is due to the batch file, which says to delete itself.
</p>
<br>
<p>
I noticed internet explorer was running in the background the entire time and from class learned that IE can often be used for URL retrieval. Furthermore, from class we learned the actual intentions of the malware was to hack into a korean banking system and install credit card schemers.

<h1 align="center"> WEEK 2: Advanced Forensic Analysis</h1>
<br>

<div style="margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;text-align:left">
<font size="4">
<p>
This week’s advance forensics topic primarily focused on the role of a software engineer plays legally and technically to apprehend suspects. Most of the lecture material spent a significant amount of time emphasizing the importance of only reporting the evidence present and not becoming biased. We also learned about about the RFC 3227 protocol. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
As a novice in the field of security, it’s interesting to see a formal process in which attacks are handled. I would have assumed that most security teams would handle attacks on a per-case basis. For example, if the attacker knew about the RFC process, it seems like he/she would anticipate the white hats counterattack and prepare. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
RFC 3227 specified the order of volatility in which white-hats should address a attack. For example, system memory refers to the OS and System application. This would be most volatile because user applications are located in system memory. Temporary files like swap files and paging files are essential because they use local memory for reading/writing and are essential tools for the hacker. Christian emphasized the importance of cutting off the network connection as the first step rather than the power. After he mentioned it, I recognize how easy it is for the hackers to track white-hats if their network port isn’t blocked. The next volatility level was ARP cache and routing tables. ARP cache stores the local data such as MAC addresses and is cleared on reboot. Routing tables has next-hop routing and has dynamic routes which are built after each reboot. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
RFC 3327 also emphasizes the tools that are available to the white-hat’s disposal. A majority of the tools are not extremely sophisticated, but command-line arguments like examining processes, system states, bit-copies, checksums and core-images. I know how to use most of these tools, but it’s pretty cool to see different contexts in which the command-line arguments are being used.
</p>
<br>
<p>	The labs explored the tools which are at the disposal of software forensic analysers. For example, FTK is a forensic toolkit which looks through hard drives. FTK can find deleted emails, text strings and crack passwords. FTK imager saves an image or portions of the hard disk to be reconstructed later. FTK imager uses MD5 hash to confirm integrity, so the image file can be saved in several formats. The FTK imager takes the memory dump, serial number, date and does memory dumps. A special feature about VM’s mentioned in the lab is the ability to shut them down and copy out specific files. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
The second lab explored the volatility toolkit. Using the cheat-sheet we saw where volatile memory dumps were using commands such as volatility-2.3.1 standalone -f memdump_sample1.mem imageinfo etc and volatility-2.3.1 standalone -f memdump_sample1.mem profile = win7SP0x86 psscan.

<h1 align="center"> WEEK 3: Malware Defense (February 3rd 2017)</h1>

<h2 align=center>About Malware Defense:</h2>
Malware has a variety of attack vectors through which it infiltrates computers. For example, some common channels include email, IM, compromised sites & servers, malvertising, physical access (USB), etc, social engineering such as social media, IM, email, 
exploitation through watering hole attacks, malvertising, physical access, or a combination for poisoned search results. The extent of social engineering includes inadvertently running an executable, exploitation includes browser-based exploit kits such as script, pdf, and java. Features such as USB and physical access are often also abused in malware. 
</p>
<br>

<p>
	Typically the first point of contact is through spam, networks, web or physical access. These can be prevented through anti-spam, firewall, network ISP, IP, Domain and URL reputation, and disk encryption. Similarly, local execution and malware with an established presence can take place through spam, network web and hosts. These can be prevented through client-side content filtering, network IPS, content scanning, antivirus, whitelisting etc. In the event of malicious activity, typically hosts, networks, web and data loss are typically experienced which can be mitigated through anti-virus, NIPS, firewall, domain, url rep and content filtering etc. 
</p>
<br>
<p>

	Oftentimes from threats, we can see that the firewall, network reputation, anit-spam, web reputation, exploit prevention, system policies, application/access control, anti-malware and data loss prevention are all common malware defense techniques. In fact, most companies are starting to use a central point which gathers intelligence from all of these sources to create a holistic picture of the malware. This is essential, because it’s important to anticipate the threat going and not releasing new content or updates. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
<h2 align=center>About the Lab:</h2>
	One common way to identify malware is to use the pattern matching  yara software. Yara supplies an IDE to write our “rules”, which can either be written by us or generated. The malware is browsed and analyzed based on the rules. We used Yara in our labs to dissect the different malware samples. Craig recommended making our own rules instead of the generated ones, because then everything would be highlighted and we wouldn't gain any insight. He also recommended examining samples using fileinsight to predict variants. Common issues to consider with malware is signatures while shipping and false positives. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
	
	During our lab we could execute in command line using yara.exe and include number of threads and timeout. All the files were located under the c:\Users\Admin\desktop\Tools\malware\Malware defense folder. There are seven samples under the Sytro directory. I tried to execute the example BadBoy script, but after it compiled and executed there were no matches. I also tried to writing a modified BadBoy rule which included the directory to the malicious file directory (c:\Users\Admin\desktop\Tools\malware\Malware defense\Class1\Samplegroup1\Sytro). However, writing out the entire directory wasn’t helpful either. Even commenting out and rename a few of the sample files to find a match didn’t yield any results. The origional hashes are 068D5C62254DC82F3697847C16710B7, 00670F2B9631D0F97C7CFC6C764DD9D9, 4844FD851088A11E240CFE5BS4096209, A1874714F7A15399BFAE9681808B303.
</p>
<p>
	The second portion of the lab, I tried to write a signature similar to :
<br><br>
	rule example{
<br>
		&nbsp;strings:
<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;$a = "C:\\Users\Admin\desktop\Tools\malware\Malwaredefense\Class2\test_1"
<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;$b = "C:\\Users\Admin\desktop\Tools\malware\Malwaredefense\Class2\test_2"
<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;$c = "C:\\Users\Admin\desktop\Tools\malware\Malwaredefense\Class2\test_3"
<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;$d = "C:\\Users\Admin\desktop\Tools\malware\Malwaredefense\Class2\test_4"
<br>
		&nbsp;conditions:
<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;$a or $b or $c or $d
<br>
	}
</p>

<br>
<p>
 I think there is something about yara that I am using incorrectly. For example, it was pointed out during the lecture UPX packer was typically associated with malware and delph is usually present too in windows file. Going through the files in the beans IDE, there was the qq.com url. Someone else used all these pieces to write a signature which identified the malware, but mine did not work. Another possible route is that the DLL is also using Delphi. There seemed to be a transfer of coins to the irc client and registry value creation refering back to the QQ. 


</p>
<br>
<p>
From the lab, I saw that there must be extremely good training sets to prevent false positives and give you good rules. Dissecting the samples further, there were two distinct groups: loaded six link libraries  (unable to run program name) and three link library (distinctive public keys). 
</p>
<br>
<p>
	We also explored the another malware analysis software, cuckoo in our second lab. Cuckoo analyzes samples inside a VM and can analyze malicious files, trace api calls, dump (encrypted)  network traffic, and advanced memory analysis. This is a fairly effective solution because physical machine throughput less effective than virtual and cuckoo can handle a lot of different executables.
